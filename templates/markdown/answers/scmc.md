## The Facts

The Strengthening the Church Members Committee is a watchdog group in the LDS
church which monitors "the publications of church members for possible
criticism of local and general leaders of the church". [^1]  The committee's
existence is controversial enough that church spokesman Michael Purdy initially
claimed not to have any information about it, when asked about it in a 2012 BBC
documentary.  When pressed for details he did admit that it exists, but
couldn't or wouldn't give any further information at the time of the interview.
